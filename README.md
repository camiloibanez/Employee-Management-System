# Java Final Project

### Problem Statement:
You need to create an Employee Management System for a company. This
EMS should be able to add new Employees, update Employee information,

to keep track of all the departments in the company and which employees
are within them. You will write a text file with employee information named

able to read this information on the first run of your program then move data
over and save it as a csv. Then use this csv to read and update information as
needed.
